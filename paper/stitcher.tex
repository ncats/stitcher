\section{Introduction}
As the volume of biological data continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, data de-duplication---also commonly known as record linkage or \emph{entity resolution}---is proportionally playing a prominent role in data integration. From the construction of training data for machine learning to building knowledge graphs as epistemological frameworks for artificial intelligence, proper entity resolution is essential in generating ground-truth data. The core challenge of entity resolution is in establishing \emph{uniqueness}. For well-defined entity types (e.g., gene, tissue, cell line), uniqueness is determined solely based on established identifiers and nomenclature; for other entity types (e.g., drug, disease, phenotype), however, uniqueness is not as well-established due to conceptual ambiguities in how entities are defined and represented. Take the disease entity type as an example. The discrepancy between the theoretical concept of ``disease entity'' from its clinical nosology \citep{Hucklenbroich14} is what makes disease entity resolution extremely challenging.

Herein we report on our recent data integration effort to build a comprehensive resource of drugs that have either been marketed or approved in the United States for human use. Such a resource is not only instrumental for drug repurposing but also serves as a valuable tool to further our understanding of the mechanistic properties of molecular targets \citep{Huang2019}. To the best of our knowledge, \textbf{InXight Drugs} is currently the most comprehensive resource of its kind. In the remainder of this paper, we discuss data integration challenges associated with drug data, conceptually as well as technically. This discussion serves as the backdrop for the development of \textbf{Stitcher}, an entity resolution framework that we have developed to address the shortcomings of traditional approaches.

\subsection{What is a ``drug''?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Summarize from \citep{Huang2011}
\item Distinction between different drug classes (e.g., small molecule, monoclonal antibodies, etc.); cite ISO 11238?
\item Introduce concepts for active moiety, salt form, excipient, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{When are two drugs equivalent? (or Drug identity and equivalence)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Layout the challenges in determining when two drugs are equivalent. This will depend on drug classes. For example, for small molecules, discuss salt forms, metals, and esters; for biologics, biosimilar; etc.
\item Discuss the different types of identifier; INN, USAN, IUPAC, InChI, CAS, UNII, PubChem, company code, etc. Also address the challenge on the evolution of the drug identifier from discovery (where stereochemistry can be ambiguous) to approval.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Approach}

\begin{methods}
\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
The core premise behind \textbf{Stitcher} is that data integration is often done within the context of a specific data source. This is a reasonable assumption given the data quality varies when integrating across disparate sources. Futhermore, by establishing a reference data source for data integration, we have finer control over the following:
\begin{unlist}
\item{\emph{Data quality}.} A reference data source is typically selected such that it is of high quality. Here, we can also impose other data quality constraints (e.g., no synonyms can span multiple entities) to guide entity resolution.
\item{\emph{Data resolution}.} Entity resolution is particularly challenging when data integration involves ontologies. A reference data source can serve as the anchor ontology from which other ontologies can be mapped. As with data quality, we can also impose any additional semantic constraints; e.g., prostate cancer is not one of the diagnoses for a female patient in an electronic health record.
\item{\emph{Data curation}.} Generating ground-truth data is more managable with a single data source than across multiple data sources. This is particularly important due to the iterative feedback between data curation and data integration.
\end{unlist}
In general, data integration with \textbf{Stitcher} consists of four basic steps: \emph{ingestion}, \emph{stitching}, \emph{entity resolution}, and \emph{entity normalization}. With the exception of \emph{entity resolution}, all other steps---as they are currently implemented in \textbf{Stitcher}---are generic and can be applied to a wide range of entity types.

\subsection{Data ingrestion}
\textbf{Stitcher} is capable of ingesting data in a wide variety of sources and formats. Semantic formats such as OWL, RDF, and Turtle are supported as are JSON, delimiter separated text, and custom formats. For non-semantic format, a separate configuration file is required to map properties to \emph{stitch keys}.
